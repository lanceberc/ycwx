<span class="about-h3">Current Conditions</span>
<p>
  The current conditions shown at the top of the page come directly from sensors at StFYC and Tinsley Island.
</p>
<p>
  An <a href="https://airmar.com/productdescription.html?id=160">Airmar PB-200</a> above the Race Office has
  an ultrasonic doppler-based anemometer, thermometer, barometer, and several other sensors. It sends data twice
  per second via NMEA-0183 to a computer over a RS-422 4800 Baud serial line (read and interpreted by bespoke StFYC
  software).
</p>
<p>
  A <a href="https://weatherflow.com/tempest-weather-system/">WeatherFlow Tempest</a> weather station above the
  Clippership Room and another on Tinsley Island have sensors for wind, rain, sunlight, temperature,
  barometric pressure, and lightning. Wind data is sent via WiFi every three seconds to a local system and WeatherFlow's
  network while other data is sent once per minute. Tinsley data comes via WeatherFlow's cloud-based APIs.
</p>
<p>
  We use the Airmar for wind and the Tempests for temperature and barometric pressure. If the Tempests are not providing
  data the system falls back to nearby NOAA sites and there will be an asterisk next to the readings.
</p>

<div><img src="./images/wind.jpg" class="about-image"></div>
<span class="about-h3">Wind</span>
<p>
  Current wind and recent wind history are from the Airmar above the Race Office. Wind strength is averaged over the
  last two minutes and gusts are the highest 1-second reading in the past two minutes.
</p>
<p>
  If a gust has been over <span class="highWindThreshhold"></span>kts in the last <span class="highWindDuration"></span> seconds
  the display will switch to the wind display and the wind history graph's Y-axis increases to 45kts.
</p>
<p>
  As of this writing the Airmar wind strength seems to be fairly accurate when the wind is above ~5kts while the Tempest
  always reads low. Neither give accurate wind direction. Inaccuracies are probably due to sensor location and may be
  addressed in the future by putting the Airmar on a taller mast.

<div><img src="./images/observations.jpg" class="about-image"></div>
<span class="about-h3">Observations</span>
<p>
  Current weather observations come from <a href="https://synopticdata.com/">Synoptic Data</a> which is contracted
  by the US Government to gather weather data from many sources and make it available for free via a web API. This
  database does not seem to be updated as frequently as the sensor sites so it may be a bit stale.
</p>
<p>
  Local radar and warnings are from NOAA's <a href="https://radar.weather.gov/">NEXRAD</a> composite
  system and the National Weather Service (NWS).
</p>

<div><img src="./images/tide+current.jpg" class="about-image"></div>
<span class="about-h3">Tides & Currents</span>
<p>
  Tidal data is from <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stationhome.html?id=9414290">NOAA's tide station at Ft Point</a>
  which has been in operation since the Civil War. Currents are
  <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/ofs_station.html?stname=E%20of%20Golden%20Gate%20Bridge&ofs=sfb&stnid=SFB1203&subdomain=en">
    modeled at a point just inside the Golden Gate Bridge</a> by NOAA's Operational Forecast System (OFS).
  Beware - the local tide book uses a point just outside the GG Bridge close to Pt Diablo.
  Some current timings and astronomical data come from the <a href="https://flaterco.com/xtide/">XTide</a>
  program which implements NOAA's harmonic tidal model.
</p>

<span class="about-h3">SFBay Currents</span>
<p>(Not Currently Active)</p>
<p>
  The SF Bay current graphics are from NOAA's
  <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/sfbofs/sfbofs_info.html">SF Bay Operational Forecast System (OFS or SFBOFS)</a>
  which runs a numerical model of bay tides/currents every six hours and produces hourly forecasts.

<div><img src="./images/nws_forecast.jpg" class="about-image"></div>
<span class="about-h3">NWS Forecasts</span>
<p>
  Text forecasts for the Bay Area and nearby waters are produced by the National Weather Service (NWS)
  <a href="https://www.weather.gov/mtr/">SF Bay Weather Field Office (WFO)</a> in
  Monterey which develops and runs some of the Navy's weather models.

<span class="about-h3">WeatherFlow Forecasts</span>
<p>
  <a href="https://weatherflow.com/">WeatherFlow</a> combines the data it gathers from customer weather stations with NOAA
  models to produce forecasts tailored to customer locations and different activities. They also
  run the popular sports weather web sites and apps
  <a href="https://sailflow.com/">SailFlow</a>,
  <a href="https://wx.iwindsurf.com/">iWindSurf</a>, and
  <a href="https://wx.ikitesurf.com/">iKiteSurf</a>. WeatherFlow uses the data from the Tempest weather stations at the
  <a href="https://tempestwx.com/station/74155/">City clubsite</a> and
  <a href="https://tempestwx.com/station/42921/">Tinsley Island</a> as input for the custom local forcasts.

<span class="about-h3">Surface Analysis</span>
<p>
  The surface analysis chart is produced by human forecasters at
  <a href="ocean.weather.gov">NOAA's Ocean Prediction Center (OPC)</a>. They have other predictive charts
  for the North Pacific (and elsewhere) that go out ~96 hours.

<div><img src="./images/sat_image.jpg" class="about-image"></div>
<span class="about-h3">Satellite Images & Time-lapse Movies</span>
<p>
  GOES-WEST (aka GOES-18) satellite images come from the
  <a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/">National Environmental Data and Information Service (NESDIS)</a>
  repository. Raw images are processed (reprojected to Mercator, cropped, etc) using
  <a href="https://github.com/lanceberc/GOES/blob/master/GOES_GDAL.ipynb">locally-developed image processing code</a>.
  The <a href="https://rammb-slider.cira.colostate.edu/?sat=goes-17">GeoColor algorithm</a> used to color the images was developed at
  <a href="https://www.cira.colostate.edu/">CIRA/RAAMB</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Time-lapse MPEG movies are created locally from the satellite images using <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a>.

<span class="about-h3">National Radar & Warnings, Cloud Tops</span>
<p>
  NOAA has made an effort  to make its various data and forecast products available on
  the Internet in many forms. The National Radar map overlays recent NEXRAD radar mosaics on top of current hazard,
  watch, and warning areas. More information is available from NOAA's
  <a href="https://nowcoast.noaa.gov">NowCOAST</a> and
  <a href="https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/map/?&zoom=14&scroll_zoom=false&center=39.198404895765826,-120.23180007934572&boundaries=false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false,false&tab=observation&obs=true&obs_type=air_temp&obs_popup=true&obs_density=10&obs_provider=ALL">Weather & Hazards</a> data viewers.

<span class="about-h3">Data Ingestion and Processing</span>
<p>
  All data is ingested and processed on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi 4</a>
  at StFYC which also runs the web & websocket servers that provide these pages.
  <a href="https://www.github.com/lanceberc/ycwx">Scripts and programs</a> are written in C, bash, Python, and Go.
